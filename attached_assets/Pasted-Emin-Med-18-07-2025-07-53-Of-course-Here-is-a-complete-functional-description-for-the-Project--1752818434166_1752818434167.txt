Of course. Here is a complete functional description for the "Project Sanad" web application. This document is designed to be given directly to a web developer. It details all pages, components, and functionalities without specifying the underlying technology, allowing the developer to choose the best stack for the job.
Project Blueprint: The "Project Sanad" Data Annotation Platform
Project Overview & Core Goal:
"Project Sanad" is a professional, role-based web application designed to manage a high-throughput data creation workflow. Its primary goal is to facilitate the creation of a large, high-quality dataset for training AI models, specifically for translating text from Formal Arabic to the Hassaniya dialect. The platform must be efficient, scalable, and quality-focused, serving as the central "data factory" for a team of administrators, translators, and quality assurance reviewers.
Core Concepts:
 * Role-Based Access Control: The platform will have distinct roles (Admin, Translator, QA Lead), each with a specific interface and set of permissions.
 * Status-Driven Workflow: Every piece of data (a "Work Item") moves through a clear lifecycle: Pending Assignment -> In Progress -> In QA -> Approved / Rejected.
 * Flexibility through Templates: The Admin can create new "Instruction Templates" to define new tasks and data formats without needing developer intervention, ensuring the platform's long-term flexibility.
🎨 Design System Integration
The entire application must be built using the provided Design System. This ensures a clean, consistent, and professional user experience.
 * Primary Accent (#4ADE80): Use for all primary action buttons (Login, Submit for QA, Approve, Save Template), active navigation links, and progress indicators.
 * Background (#F9FAFB): The default background color for all main content areas.
 * Sidebar (#FFFFFF with soft shadow): The main navigation sidebar should use this to create a clean separation.
 * Text Primary (#111827): For all page titles, section headers, and important labels.
 * Text Secondary (#6B7280): For sub-labels, instructional hints, metadata (dates, names), and placeholder text.
 * Borders/Dividers (#E5E7EB): For table borders, separating cards, and horizontal rules.
 * Error Red (#EF4444): For all "Reject" buttons, error messages, and validation failures.
👤 User Roles & Permissions
 * Admin: Full access to all pages and settings. Manages users, sources, templates, and assignments. Can perform any role.
 * Translator: Limited access. Can only view and complete tasks assigned to them.
 * QA Lead: Limited access. Can only view and take action on tasks submitted for Quality Assurance.
