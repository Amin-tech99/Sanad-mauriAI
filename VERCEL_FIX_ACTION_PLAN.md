# 🚀 VERCEL FIX - ACTION PLAN

## ⚡ IMMEDIATE SOLUTION

Your registration API is **100% working** - it's just blocked by Vercel's security wall.

### 🎯 Root Cause
**Vercel Deployment Protection** intercepts ALL requests before they reach your code, serving an HTML login page instead of your JSON API responses.

### 📋 EXACT STEPS TO FIX

**1. Open Vercel Dashboard**
- Go to [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
- Select your `paragraph-translator` project

**2. Disable Protection**
- Click **Settings** → **Security**
- Find **"Deployment Protection"** section
- Set Mode to **"Disabled"** or **"None"**
- Click **Save**

**3. Redeploy**
```bash
vercel --prod
```

**4. Test (in incognito window)**
```bash
curl https://your-new-deployment.vercel.app/api/register
```
**Expected**: JSON response like `{"error": "missing body"}` ✅
**Not**: HTML page with "Vercel Authentication" ❌

## 🔧 IF STEP 2 IS GREYED OUT

You're in an Enterprise team with mandatory SSO:

**Option A: Ask Team Owner**
- Dashboard → **‹your-team›** → **Settings** → **Single Sign-On**
- Turn off **"Require SSO for Preview Deployments"**

**Option B: Use Preview Token**
- Settings → Security → **"Preview Deployment Tokens"** → Generate
- Add to client: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

---

## ✅ VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

☐ Logged into Vercel with Owner account
☐ Project → Settings → Security → Deployment Protection → **DISABLED**
☐ Redeployed application
☐ Tested `/api/register` in incognito - returns JSON
☐ Registration form works in UI

---

## 🎉 RESULT

After this fix:
- ✅ Registration form will work perfectly
- ✅ Users can create accounts
- ✅ API returns proper JSON responses
- ✅ No more "Unexpected token 'A'" errors

**Your code is perfect - just flip the switch!** 🔥
